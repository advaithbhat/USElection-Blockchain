# USElection-Blockchain
This is a decentralized election application working on Ethereum blockchain. Here a client-side application is built that will communicate with the smart contract on the blockchain.
The client-side application will have a table of candidates that lists each candidate's id,name and vote count. It will have a form where we can cast the vote for the desired candidate.
Once an account casts vote for the candidate of his/her choice the form is hidden so that the particular account cannot cast vote again.
This application requires a few dependencies such as Node Packet Manager(NPM), Truffle framework, Ganache and Metamask.
